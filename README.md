# Linked List Phonebook 


 In this project, We create a phonebook application that stores contact 
information using a linked list data structure. The application allow users to add, search, and delete 
contacts from the phonebook.
User can search for contacts based on multiple criteria (e.g., name, phone number, email address).
Also he can schedule events and appointments with contacts.


# The project is under the supervision of Dr. Mohammed Alzaid.
